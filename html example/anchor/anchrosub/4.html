        <div style=" text-align: left; ">Nadella[9][10][11] was born into a Telugu speaking family[11] in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, India. His father, Bukkapuram Nadella Yugandher, was a civil servant of the Indian Administrative Service.[12][13] Nadella attended the Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet[14] before attaining a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering[15] from the Manipal Institute of Technology in 1988 (then affiliated with Mangalore University), Manipal, Karnataka.[16][17][18][19][20]

        Nadella subsequently traveled to the U.S. to study for an M.S. degree in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Milwaukee,[21] receiving his degree in 1990.[22] Later he received an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.[23][24]

        Nadella said he "always wanted to build things".[25] He knew that computer science was what he wanted to pursue,[26] but that passion was at precocious stage while studying at Manipal University. "And so it [electrical engineering] was a great way for me to go discover what turned out to become a passion," he says.[27]
