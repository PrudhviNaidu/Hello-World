    <div>Most of these studies have been conducted in artificial seawater medium of known composition, pH and ionic strength.
        <div style="font-size:15px; color:red; width:600px;">While this approach is useful in the laboratory, extrapolation to natural systems is currently impossible since the activity of copper in natural seawater cannot be determined directly. The importance of the latter difficulty is emphasized by studies suggesting that copper binding organic ligands are present in sufficient quantities to effect the speciation of copper in seawater (Batley and Florence, 1976; Florence and Batley, 1976; Williams and Baldwin, 1976; Sugai and Healy, 1978).</div>
